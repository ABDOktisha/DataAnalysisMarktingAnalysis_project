# Marketing Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing marketing data to extract valuable insights about customer behavior, campaign performance, and overall market trends. The analysis aims to support data-driven decision-making by leveraging cleaned datasets, advanced SQL queries, and interactive visualizations through Power BI.

---

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning**: Use SQL to preprocess raw datasets and ensure data consistency, accuracy, and usability.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Gain insights from the cleaned data, such as identifying trends, customer segmentation, and campaign success metrics.
- **Visualization**: Build interactive dashboards in Power BI to make insights accessible and actionable for stakeholders.

---

## Features

- **SQL Data Cleaning**: Predefined scripts to handle missing data, outliers, and duplicates.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Visualizations that allow stakeholders to explore key performance indicators (KPIs) such as customer retention, sales performance, and campaign ROI.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Data-backed recommendations to optimize marketing strategies.
